## Color Treatment Guidelines

All images should be treated to work with the bold black (#000000) and energetic yellow (#FFD700) color scheme:

1. **Contrast Enhancement:**
   - Increase contrast to ensure visibility against black backgrounds
   - Preserve highlights that can work with yellow accents

2. **Color Grading:**
   - Slightly desaturate to not compete with the yellow accent color
   - Add a subtle yellow tint (5-10% opacity) for consistency
   - Ensure skin tones remain natural

3. **Background Integration:**
   - Darken shadows to blend with black backgrounds
   - Add subtle vignettes to focus attention on subjects
   - Create depth with layered elements

## Implementation Notes

1. **File Format:**
   - Primary: WebP for modern browsers with JPEG fallback
   - Meme gallery: PNG for sharp text and graphics

2. **Optimization:**
   - All images under 300kb each
   - Responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
   - Lazy loading attributes for performance

3. **Naming Convention:**
   - Use descriptive, SEO-friendly filenames
   - Lowercase with hyphens (e.g., climate-action-campaign.jpg)

4. **Accessibility:**
   - All images must have descriptive alt text
   - Decorative images should have empty alt attributes
   - Consider colorblind accessibility in image selection

## Placeholder Implementation

Until actual images are sourced, use CSS-generated placeholders with the following characteristics:
- Black background (#000000) with charcoal gradients (#111111)
- Yellow border (#FFD700 at 20% opacity)
- Text indicating the image purpose
- Subtle animated effects to match the dynamic design

## Video Content

For short-form video embeds:
- Prepare 16:9 format videos (1920x1080px)
- Keep under 60 seconds for social sharing
- Include captions for accessibility
- Optimize for silent autoplay (important for social feeds)

## Campaign Process Videos

For behind-the-scenes content:
- Show the campaign creation process from start to finish
- Highlight the strategy and creativity involved
- Keep under 30 seconds for Instagram Reels/TikTok
- Use trending audio where appropriate
